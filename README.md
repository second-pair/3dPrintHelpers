#  3D Print Helpers
A ~~plethora of~~ single helper for interacting with 3D printing.

Inserts a pause after a specified layer into Marlin-flavoured G-Code.  The print should remain paused until the operator uses the LCD to resume the print.  The operator can then embed things (like magnets), or swap filament, before resuming the print.
